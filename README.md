To-DO list application console-based

This is a simple console-based To-Do List application that I created using Python. The main idea of this project is to let the user add tasks, view all the tasks, and remove tasks whenever they want. I built this project to practice basic Python concepts like lists, loops, conditions, and user input handling.

The program starts by showing a small menu with four options: add a task, view tasks, remove a task, and exit. I used a while True loop so that the menu keeps appearing until the user chooses to exit. This makes the program run continuously without restarting every time.

All the tasks are stored in a Python list called tasks. Whenever the user selects the “add task” option, the program asks them to enter the task name and then adds it to the list. When the user chooses the option to view tasks, the program prints all the tasks with numbering so the user can see them clearly.

For removing tasks, the program first shows the list of tasks and then asks the user to enter the task number they want to delete. I used pop() to remove the task from the list. If the user enters something invalid or tries to remove a task when no tasks exist, the program handles it without crashing.

The exit option simply breaks the loop and stops the program.

Overall, this project helped me understand how to work with lists, how to build menu-driven programs, and how to handle user input. It is a simple beginner-friendly project and gives a basic idea of how a task manager works.
